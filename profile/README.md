**Building Minimalist AI Agents for Maximum Impact**

Welcome to **Reagent Systems**, where we focus on crafting lightweight, modular AI agents that are easy to understand, extend, and deploy. Our philosophy centers on simplicity and clarity, ensuring that AI agents remain accessible and effective.

## 🚀 Our Mission

At Reagent Systems, we believe that AI agents don't need to be complex to be powerful. By emphasizing a small set of core operations and utilizing function-based interactions, we aim to:

- **Simplify** the development and deployment of AI agents.
- **Modularize** components for easy customization and scalability.
- **Demystify** agent behavior by maintaining transparent and traceable logic.

## 🧩 Core Projects

### [`Simple-Agent-Core`](https://github.com/reagent-systems/Simple-Agent-Core)

A lightweight, minimalist framework for building AI agents with a clean event loop and pluggable command system.

**Features:**

- 🧠 Minimalist Design – Only essential components, no bloat
- 🧩 Modular Command System – Each command lives in its own folder
- 🔧 Function-Based Operations – Actions are invoked through clear function calls

---

### [`Simple-Agent-Tools`](https://github.com/reagent-systems/Simple-Agent-Tools) *(In Progress)*

We’re currently in the process of splitting out tools and commands from the core into a dedicated repo. This will:

- Keep the core repo lean and stable
- Allow tools to be loaded dynamically via API
- Make it easier to extend agents with custom capabilities

Expect a collection of drop-in tools for common tasks like web search, file access, data parsing, API interactions, and more.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Languages:** Python
- **Frameworks:** OpenAI, Anthropic APIs, FastAPI (planned)
- **Tooling:** GitHub Actions, Docker, Modular CLI utilities
